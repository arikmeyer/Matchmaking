# Product Engineer /  Product-minded Fullstack Engineer

# Background

We're rethinking how a service-led B2C business operates \- automation and AI-first, based on smart, safe, and lifelong trust-based relationships with users. 

**Switchup today**

We are serving hundreds of thousands of households in Germany, monitoring energy subscriptions and ensuring people are not being overcharged by their providers. The thing that holds us back from growing is: operational scalability. Our service colleagues spend far too much time manually handling repetitive tasks. A perfect case for workflow automation (first), and creating an environment where AI agents and humans seamlessly work together (later).

**Switchup of the future**

Imagine a service that has the full overview of all your subscriptions \- energy, telco, streaming, anything. It continuously makes sure you're getting a fair deal, filters out the communication noise, and proactively takes tasks off your table. This is what Switchup aims to become. We're rebuilding our platform to easily scale to any subscription type, and to be the perfect place where humans and AI can work together. We employ automation and AI not to replace human customer support, but to augment it, so that we can offer a trust-based 1:1 service relationship with our users. 

**The big challenges:**

* Making (architectural) decisions that are **provider** (e.g. Vattenfall, E.ON) and **market** (e.g. energy, telco) **agnostic**, so that we could move from "Energy in Germany" to "any subscription around the globe".  
* Automating manual touchpoints in a way that is **highly configurable, yet robust**. Building robust automated flows that drive business results requires experimentation. The need to experiment \+ our desire to roll out additional markets requires us to be able to make changes to workflows quickly. Oftentimes, configurability and robustness are at odds: How can we create configurable systems, whilst keeping complexity at bay?

# Why Switchup

* **Rethink from the ground up** \- Help build an AI-first technical platform and organization with a small, talented team that values learning, experimentation, and constructive challenge.   
* **Shape the organization** \- Join a small core team at a pivotal moment. We're hiring several product engineers. You'll help define how we work and can bring in peers you believe are a perfect fit.   
* **High-impact work** \- Switchup has product-market fit but is limited by operational scalability. Better automation directly enables serving far more households with excellent service.  
* **Mission that matters (and isn’t just a hiring-ploy)** \- Protect consumers from unfair treatment by energy providers (and soon, telcos). It's genuinely good work that makes a real difference in the lives of our users.   
* **Your kind of people** \- Self-motivated, curious, experimental, eager to learn. We are sitting in the same boat and continuously share our learnings (failures being a valuable insight) so that we amplify each other.

# What You'll Do

* **Take full ownership of a domain \-** from understanding the problem and desired outcomes, to researching tools and executing the solution. No product owner/manager, no specs besides your own.  
* **Build automation flows** \- using a workflow engine like Windmill \+ TypeScript  
* **Drive business outcomes** \- success is "we reduced case-type X by 90%”,  not "the flow didn't break"  
* **Design and handle monitoring** to detect breakage, prevent harm, and validate impact

# Hard Skills

* **10+ years engineering experience**; 1+ years product experience/eagerness to take full ownership of a problem-space  
* **Strong engineering fundamentals** \- how do we build something that is highly configurable, yet robust?  
* **Eagerness to learn new tools and stay current** \- we regularly experiment with new open source solutions as they emergy

# Soft Skills

* **Startup experience,** engineers who have built 0-1   
* **Dig into business intent**, not just technical requirements  
* **Experimental mindset** \- deliver value incrementally, learn, adjust  
* **Comfortable with ambiguity** \- you define what to build  
* **Ownership mentality** \- challenge us if we're not setting you up for success  
* **Curious about new tools and AI** \- stay current with tooling/LLM developments  
* **Cross-pollination** \- share learnings, connect dots across the team

# Tech stack

|  | Stack | Rationale | Can I challenge this? |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Languages** | Typescript (primary), Python, Rust or Go (when needed)  | Languages that facilitate effective AI-enabled coding | Yes |
| **AI models** | Claude Code (currently, until a better model emerges) | Facilitating AI-enabled ways-of-working throughout our entire organization, drawing upon & actively experimenting with new advancements (skills, sub-agent delegation, etc.)  | Yes |
| **LLMOps** | Langfuse | Being able to review LLM actions and ability for admins (our internal users) to a/b test models/prompts/classifications/etc.  | Yes |
| **Workflow engine** | Windmill.dev | Running hundreds of millions of workflow instances reliably with good tracing and giving workflow admins the tooling to read/review/update workflows | Yes |
| **Browser Automation** | Playwright | Running hundreds of bot automations to retrieve \+ submit data via provider portals and a setup that facilitates the job of bot admins including self-healing RPA scripts | Yes |
| **Database** | Neon DB | Ability to test schema changes and other updates via db branches | Yes |

# Great Fit Elsewhere, Not Here

* Specialists who go deep in one area without connecting to business problems  
* Engineers who thrive with detailed specs from a product team  
* Craftspeople who optimize within familiar tools rather than adopting the best tool for the job  
* People who don’t get excited about any of the stuff above

# Ideas to make it engaging / make it easier for our perfect people to raise their hands

1. “Watch me work video”. Record a video where you explain real work you’ve done. For example: The work you’ve done for the [e.ON](http://e.ON) bot. Why does this matter, what result is it supposed to drive, then diving into the actual flow, things that are difficult. Also explaining the tools/libraries you selected and why.   
   End on “This is the type of stuff you’ll be doing. If you’re excited about diving in, let’s talk” 

   Why it works: Engineers who love solving real problems will be hooked by the specificity. Plus, it doesn’t get much more transparent than that,

2. "Engineering bets". Discuss important architectural bets you're making. For example: DDD; Windmill; xxx? Explain the context, what you're exploring, the tensions you're navigating, the open questions. Allow watchers to easily submit feedback if they feel compelled to do so. 

   Why it works: Shows how you think. Demonstrates learning culture (and desire to be challenged). Filters for people who love ambiguity vs. need certainty.
